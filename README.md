 Customer Shopping Behavior Data Analytics Project
** Overview**

This project performs an end-to-end analysis of customer shopping behavior to generate actionable business insights. The workflow includes data loading in Python, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based querying, Power BI dashboard development, and final reporting with presentation.

The goal is to understand customer purchasing patterns, segmentation, and revenue contribution to support data-driven decision-making.

==== Dataset====

The dataset contains customer transactional and shopping behavior data, including:

Customer ID

Purchase history

Product/category information

Transaction amount

Purchase frequency

Date-related fields

The data was analyzed to identify trends, customer segments, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data loading, cleaning, and EDA

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server) – Data querying and aggregation

Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation

Gamma – Presentation (PPT) development

Jupyter Notebook – Analysis execution environment

⚙️ Project Steps
1️⃣ Data Loading

Imported dataset into Python using Pandas

Inspected structure, columns, and data types

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Removed duplicates

Standardized formats

Ensured data consistency

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed purchase trends

Evaluated revenue distribution

Studied customer frequency behavior

Generated visual insights

4️⃣ SQL Analysis

Imported cleaned dataset into database

Executed SQL queries using:

GROUP BY

CASE statements for segmentation

Aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)

Derived business KPIs and metrics

5️⃣ Dashboard Development

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard

Implemented filters and slicers

Displayed KPIs, revenue trends, and customer segments

6️⃣ Reporting & Presentation

Created a structured analytical report

Developed a professional presentation summarizing:

Business problem

Methodology
